            <p>An online auction is an auction that takes place via the internet, allowing users to sell or bid for products and services online. Online auctions allow sellers to reach larger audiences, in different locations and geographical areas.</p>
            <h2>WHY WE STARTED!</h2> 
            <br>
                <p>To develop an online auction system which will provide a forum for sellers to interact with buyers and sell items to interested bidders. Away from the noisy crowds like conventional system where users have to sit for hours and bid. And wait for the immidiate declaration of the winner. Alot of time to think before making the bid.Here bidder’s can bid any time and from anywhere.</p>
