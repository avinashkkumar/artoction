                    <summary>I love art but I don’t have much knowledge, where do I start?</summary>
                    <p class="text">We always encourage our buyers to spend time doing their own research before making any purchase. You might want to have a look around to see what similar items have been fetching when they sell. Also, check descriptions thoroughly. We encourage our vendors to include as much information as possible in their listings, so study the detail of what you’re interested in, and if you have questions that remain unanswered, feel free to ask us and we can get more specifics for you.</p>

                    <summary>How do I know what is a reasonable price to spend?</summary>
                    <p class="text">As with anything at auction, research is key. When it comes to art, find out as much about the artist who made the piece and check whether these works come up regularly. This will help determine what prices you should expect.</p>

                    <summary>How do I guarantee it’s an original piece of art?</summary>
                    <p class="text">We ask our vendors to be as specific and honest as possible when listing items, so that there are no grey areas. Each item will state whether it’s an original and any further details, for example if it’s signed etc, so the buyer knows 100% what they are purchasing.</p>

                    <summary>At auction, how do I increase the chance of a successful sale of my art?</summary>
                    <p class="text">Make sure the description is correct and complete. Include all available information: on history and provenance, the artist, art movement. If there is damage, mention this. Decide on a realistic opening price and use good images of the artwork. Only use the best photos. Mention the auction on your social media to generate interest.</p>

                    <summary>How do I take a good photo of the artwork I want to auction?</summary>
                    <p class="text">Use a good quality camera and make sure the photo is in focus. Use a neutral background and (with sculpture, design pieces) take photos from all sides; also take a photo of the signature. Avoid shadows, do not use a flash, use day light. Make sure the image is level, use a tripod. To straighten the image afterwards, use the photo editing program on your laptop or mobile phone.</p>

                    <summary>I have received an artwork but it is damaged.</summary>
                    <p class="text">If you have received a damaged work (damaged during shipping or delivery, glass breakage or damage to the work itself) and this differs from the condition the vendor described, you can notify the vendor and Online Gallery. It is important to report the damage immediately – do not wait. The vendor in principle is obliged to annul the sale and take back the work, unless vendor and buyer agree otherwise. The costs of the sale and shipping/delivery charges must be paid for by the vendor. The costs of shipping/return of the work to the vendor must be paid for by the buyer.

                        Please note: unless otherwise stated damage during shipping/delivery are the responsibility of the vendor.</p>
